  Introduction Scene
  LabHub Scene
  Buoyancy Lab Scene
  Viscosity Lab Scene
  Credits Scene - viewable by compleating the experience
  Credits 1 Scene - Viewable from the start menu
  
This experience aims to teach users about some basic components of fluid mechanics by letting them directly interact with the elements

This project was compleated as a final submission for the compleation of a university program from the University of London

As fluid simulations and VR are computation Heavy applications recomended computer is a highend gameing computer.
